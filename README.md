# alon:lag-console
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MasterAM/meteor-lag-console.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MasterAM/meteor-lag-console)

A plugin for `constellation:console` that provides a UI controls for `alon:lag-methods` and `alon:lag-publications`.

It allows you to simulate actual UX in a clean way that only affects your development machine, by adding delay to methods and publications on your local server.

## Introduction
Since development is often done on a powerful local machine without much load, the  round-trip is usually very quick. Any UI changes that reflect the intermediate state often appear as a short flash of content before the view renders with the new data or state.

This behavior is different from the one that will be experienced by users of the production server, and therefore developers sometimes resort to quick and dirty ways for adding delay to their method calls (by calling `Meteor._sleepForMs()` - or dirtier solutions - directly in method code). If left alone and not cleaned up, it could eventually cause undesired delay of the deployed application.

This package is intended to provide a cleaner alternative to those dirty fixes.

The package adds delay to methods on the server only. Different delays can be configured for specific methods and the default delay can also be set (it is 2000ms by default).

## Configuration
You may configure `alon:lag-methods` and `alon:lag-publications` to your liking.

All of the config options (and other useful info) are specified in the README files ([methods](https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-methods/blob/master/README.md), [publications](https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-publications/blob/master/README.md) - the config options are very similar between them).

The only thing that has to be manually configured is the `persist` option, in case you want your configuration to survive server restarts (this option is off by default).

In this case, just add this to your json config file.

```json
{
  "lagConfig": {
    "persist": true,
  }
}
```
Note that turning this feature on creates a MongoDB collection on the development server.

The delay is disabled on startup by default. To change this behavior, use the following configuration option:

```json
{
  "lagConfig": {
    "console": {
      "disableOnStartup": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage
The package adds a tab to the Constellation panel.

This tab allows you to view and control almost all of the relevant configs.

For the following examples, the following configuration file was used:

```json
{
  "lagConfig": {
    "base": {
      "defaultDelay": 1200,
      "log": true
    },
    "methods": {
    	"delays":{
     	   "bar": 500
    	},
      "exclude": [
        "baz"
      ],
      "forceBlocking": [
        "dummy"
      ]
    },
    "publications": {
    	"delays":{
     	   "pub2": 500
    	},
      "exclude": [
        "pub3"
      ],
      "forceBlocking": [
        "pub3"
      ]
    },
    "console": {
      "disableOnStartup": false
    }
  }
}
```
Details regarding the various configuration options can be found in the README files ([methods](https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-methods/blob/master/README.md), [publications](https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-publications/blob/master/README.md)), as mentioned earlier.

Assuming it is located in `<your app's root dir>/config/settings.json`, you can start Meteor with it by using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ meteor run --settings config/settings.json
```

Here are some short screencasts that demonstrate the functionality (the captured colors are a bit different from the actual screen colors).

**Note**: the UI in the current version may differ slightly from the one in shown the examples below.

### terminology
Methods and publications are collectively referred to as _targets_.

### main panel
![main screenshot list]

The main panel contains:
- The menu, which shows the default delay and contains the settings toggle button.
- The tab and search bar.
 - The tab bar switches between the method and publication lists (_m_=methods, _p_=publications).
 - The search bar allows you to filter the list. The filter value is applied to the list that corresponds to the active tab.
- The method/publication list, that contains the names of the matching methods/publications, their configuration status and controls.

### settings tab
![main screenshot settings]

The settings tab contains controls for the general configuration options.
You can:
- change the default delay.
- print the configuration options that match the current state to the console.
- toggle the activity state of the methods, publication and global delays.
- change other general options.

### filter
![01_filter]

The search bar can accept a regular expression and filter the relevant list.
The expression is preserved when switching tabs, and re-applied to the active tab.

### activate
![02_activate]

There are several ways to activate/deactivate the plugin.
- Click on the `Default delay` (or `Activate`, when deactivated).
- Check and uncheck the `Activate` box in the settings screen.
- Click on the indicator light in the top right corner on the panel. This method can be used even when the panel is collapsed.

If disabled, none or the method calls and publications will be delayed.

### default delay
![03_default_delay]

The plugin has a default delay setting, which is specified in milliseconds.

Clicking on the default delay value in the menu bar focuses the default delay input in settings.
It can also be accessed directly.
You can use the arrow keys or type in a new value.
If you set it to `0[ms]`, only methods/publications that have custom delays will be delayed.

### per-target configuration options
![04_delay_intro]

Each target can be configured individually to have a custom delay or to be excluded and have no delay.

To the left of each target's name there are 2 small indicators/buttons:
- a green indicator - controls custom delay.
- a red indicator - controls exclusion.

Each of them shows a messaged when hovered.

The indicators are highlighted if there is a custom delay or if the target is excluded and are washed out otherwise.

As seen in the image above, hovering over the indicators shows that `foo` has no custom delay and is not excluded, and therefore will be delayed for the default time set (which is 1200 ms, as can be seen by looking at the default delay at the top-of the panel).

The method `bar` has a custom 500ms delay set and is not excluded. The custom delay will override the default one, so `bar` will be delayed by 500ms when called.

The method `baz` is excluded and therefore will not be delayed. It wouldn't be delayed even if it had custom delay set for it.

Clicking the indicators sets or unsets the respective option. For more info, see the following sections.

### exclude a target
![04_exclude]
Clicking the red indicator toggles the corresponding target's `excluded` configuration.

Some target are excluded by default, such as the methods that apply the configuration settings for this package.

### set a custom per-target delay
![05_custom_delay]

Setting a custom delay for a target is done by clicking on the green indicator, filling the desired delay (in milliseconds) and clicking `enter`. The green indicator should turn highlighted and display the new custom delay when hovered.

The custom delay can be unset by clicking on the green indicator.

In the example screencast, at first `foo` has no custom delay and therefore is delayed for the default delay of 1200 ms. After setting a custom delay of 500ms (notice the indicator is now highlighted), and now the _Loading_ indicator appears for a significantly shorter time. Another click on the green indicator unsets the custom delay.

### unblock
![07_unblock]

Calling [this.unblock()] in a method allows it to be run in parallel to other methods called by the user (when possible).

The `settings` button at the top right corner toggles the settings view.

When the settings view is visible, check/uncheck the `unblock` option to enable/disable this option.

In this example:
- `foo` has no custom settings, so it will be delayed for the default delay (1200 ms).
- `bar` has a custom delay of 500 ms.
- `baz` is excluded, and will therefore not be delayed.

The methods are called in the order `foo`>`bar`>`baz`.

**unblock enabled**

![07_unblock_enabled]

All of the methods run in parallel, so `baz` returns almost immediately, while `bar` runs and responds after 500 ms and `foo` finishes last, after 1200 ms.

**unblock disabled**

![07_unblock_disabled]

This time `foo` runs first, with a 1 second delay. Only after it is done, `bar` is processed. It is delayed for 500 more milliseconds and then `baz` starts running immediately, so `foo` returns approximately 1000 ms after the button is clicked and `bar` and `baz` return after approximately 1700ms.

### publications
![08_publications]

Publications are configured in the same way methods are. The `Publication` pages in the demo above are waiting on publications to be ready. It shows the effects of setting custom delays and excluding publications.

### granular activation
![09_granular_activation]

Methods and publications delays can be individually deactivated. If the global "Activate" option is not checked, nothing will be delayed.
If it is on, it is possible to disable only one of the target types.
In such case, the indicator in the top right corner will turn yellow.

### logging
![10_loggong]

Toggle the `Logging` checkbox to enable/disable this option.

When enabled, the package will log each target call with the delay calculated for it based on its settings.

### print config to console
![11_print_config_to_console]

Clicking on the designated text prints the current configuration to the console, both an object itself and a JSON representation of it.
It can then be edited and placed in the json configuration file.

At the moment this feature is rather crude and prints options that are set by default (such as the default force-blocking methods).

### login example
![12_login_example]

This example shows the effect of setting method delays on the login/logout action.

## Running tests
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-console.git
$ cd meteor-lag-console
$ meteor test-packages ./
```
and pointing your browser to the relevant URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
